                        Welcome to a snippet of who I am. I hope this website introduces my multiple passions, and the ways I wish to integrate all of who I am into a career.
                        
                        This website is intended to encompass all parts of who I am. I love being able to collaborate and create with people around me. Computer programming has been an incredible outlet to do this. However, there are many ways in which I do this  -- such as creating social justice documentaries, organizing events and making user experience studies. All these fundamental moments in my life have allowed me to use my interdisciplinary experiences to create opportunities that involve my computer science knowledge along with my social persona. I hope to continue to do this in whichever career I enter.

While these new obstacles approached, students continued to complete their education virtually. However, students encountered limits with the essential real world experiences their career would bestow upon them. 
                                    The lack of real world situations had become a concern within the nursing program students. In a normal world, they would experience real life situations and get hands on experience in the hospitals. <br> <br>
                                
                                    Myself and a group of Computer Science individuals took notice and felt the need to do something about it. We began to interview the nursing department faculty, as well as nursing students to discover the challenges that occured in their department. There needed to be a way in which students were able to gain real world experience through a virtual environment. <br><br>
                                
                                    Through interviews and collaboration with the nursing department, we created a virtual simulation website that were to be used for clinical scenarios. This simulation was a “choose your own path” journey for undergraduate nursing students -- which involved multiple scenarios that they would find in the real world. Through this website, students were able to continue their studies in a virtual environment.
                                <br> <br>
                                    Through this experience, I developed the following skills:

                                        The summer of 2020 brought a new birth of what was possible for virtual work. As the covid-19 pandemic hit across all parts of the world, humans quickly adapted to its circumstances. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        This new stage in the evolution of work brought the question of how virtual teams can effectively collaborate with one another via the computer screen. This question was introduced to me as I worked as an social/applied cognitive research assistant at Sandia National Laboratories under the supervision of <a href="https://maherou.github.io">Mike Heroux</a> and <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/-emraybo/staff/elaine-m-raybourn-ph-d/">Elaine Raybourn</a>. We specifically looked at how software virtual teams could effectively collaborate.
                                        <br><br>
                                        This project entailed gathering large ammounts of data and research that was related to software virtual teams. We used Github as our way to collect data. Through the use of Github, we created scholarly "templates" within the repository issues section. As we found interesting scholarly articles and findings, we would then post them onto our shared github repository. At the end of this experience, we created a central repository where individuals interested in understanding virtual collaboration could expand their knowledge. 
                                        <br>

                                        Over the summer of 2021 I had the opportunity to intern as a User Experience and User Interface developer at the <a href="https://www.arl.psu.edu">Applied Research Laboratory</a> at Penn State. Due to the confidentiality of this project, I am not able to go into specifics on the project. However, I can speak about the things I achieved during this internship and broadly speak about the project. 
    
                                        The goal of this project was to help the end users navigate information within an email alerting system. After extensive interviews with the end users of the website, I was able to learn that navigating large amounts of important information embedded in the email was often difficult.
    
                                        Due to this finding, my project entailed making an automated HTML email which could highlight important phrases, and confidentiality levels of the information within the email.

                                        My main accomplishments during this project involved creating an automated HTML email that used a Natural Language Processor (NLP) to color code important information within the email. 
    
                                        At the end of the internship, I was able to implement this new feature within the upcoming release of the website. We received positive feedback from the end users as they were able to easily navigate through large amounts of information that each email sent.

                                    Predictive algorithms influence multiple aspects of life. For the most part, these predictive algorithms play a benefit in our society. However, there are cases in which these algorithms can hinder society. Recently, algorithms within the court system have introduced an ethical discussion on how prediction algorithms are used within high-risk scenarios. The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) is a prediction system aimed to predict recidivism. Recidivism is how likely an individual will re-engage in a crime. 

                                    <br><br>This  project intended to break down the ethical, technical and social dilemma of recidivism algorithms within the court system. Further, it proceeded to analyze societies misconception and blind trust on complex algorithms. I look at the example of COMPAS and analyze its algorithm dataset. At the end, I provide future steps for recidivism prediction algorithms.

Under the supervision of the software development team, I was given the responsibility of doing extensive research on DevOps tools. The purpose of this research was to see how we could transition Inspires recent software development projects into an environment that would allow for Continue Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). The result of this approved proposal would allow more swift and efficient deployments on new software products within Inspires company.

                                My accomplishments involved creating a build pipeline through Azure DevOps that would allow for automatic testing and deployment within each new push of code. Inspires software team integrated this new tool into their most recent software deployment. As a result, programmers are able to automatically test and deploy code through the ease of a GitHub push.

                                    My project with Oleb Media sought to answer this question: Are young professionals willing to pay for a digital inclusion course?

As a result of this analysis, we were able to readjust how Oleb Media was advertising their training courses, and target specific groups of people who may be interested in the course.

                                        Over the academic year of 2022-2023 I was a Co-Director for a nonprofit student run documentary team called <a href= "http://www.extendingthelink.com">Extending the Link</a>(ETL). ETL’s project entailed the creation of an interactive film gallery. The interactive film gallery titled Diverse Bodies, Beautiful Minds: Voices of Disability Activism included insights and stories about Disability Activism. Through four short films, we showcased the voices of individuals that identify as disabled and non-disabled - establishing a narrative of authenticity and action. As a community, we joined together to learn through film and dialogue. While this gallery begins by highlighting the foundational goals of disability activism and key forms of resistance, it concludes with an exploration of intersectionality and allyship. 
    
                                        <br><br>Diverse Bodies, Beautiful Minds: Voices of Disability Activism, presents a non-traditional way of interacting and viewing film. One which uses physical space as a symbol of reflection that each member must take when presenting an individual's story and expertise. This film uses no alternative footage, but rather focuses on the footage of the interviewers as a means to emphasize the need to focus on the powerful insights each interviewer has to bring. Additionally, this film intends to find alternative ways in which we can incorporate accessibility through the use of captioning, audio captions, and ASL interpretations.
